# My CookBook Web Application

## Introduction
I created this web application to pursue my passion for cooking. As someone who loves experimenting in the kitchen and trying out new recipes, I wanted a convenient way to record my culinary creations. My CookBook allows me to easily log details about each recipe I make, including the recipe name, cook time, description, and even a photo.

## Purpose
The main purpose of My CookBook is to serve as a personal cooking diary. By documenting what I cook, I can keep track of my favorite recipes, remember successful experiments, and learn from any mishaps along the way. Additionally, I hope that by sharing my cooking adventures with friends and family through this platform, I can inspire them to explore their own culinary interests and create delicious meals of their own.

## Features
- Record details of each recipe, including name, cook time, description, and a photo.
- Easily add new recipes through a simple form submission.
- Organize and categorize recipes for easy reference.
- Share recipes with friends and family by sending them a link to the web application.

## Getting Started
To get started with My CookBook, simply visit the web application and start adding your recipes! No account creation or sign-in is required. Just fill out the form with the details of your recipe and submit it to add it to your virtual cookbook.

## Feedback
I'm always looking to improve My CookBook and make it even more useful for fellow cooking enthusiasts. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or feature requests, please feel free to reach out to me. Your input is highly valued and appreciated!

Happy cooking!
